# dmatik’s Home Assistant configuration

I’m using Lovelace mostly for my mobile devices and for Wallpanel tablet which some times used with HaDashboard instead.

The UI is partially inspired by [Homekit Infused](https://github.com/jimz011/homekit-infused), implemented by me using mostly Custom Button Card and Delluttering Card for the templates.

Please join me in discord under the following [link](https://discord.gg/ayZ3Kkg), welcome to visit and ask questions.

- Setting the header to the buttom and customizing it, all as part of the themes using [Card Mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod)

- Two colored SVG icons made by me from Material Design Icons, took the idea from [This Guy](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/a-different-take-on-designing-a-lovelace-ui/162594)
